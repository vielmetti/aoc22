## day 02

solution in awk + shell, 26 lines of code total. both shell scripts use a different awk file,
which is basically a lookup table. i guess you could be a bit more clever and get this down
to about half the code size.

it's pretty quick - about 0.02 seconds elapsed time for each of the 2 runs on a Pi 4.
